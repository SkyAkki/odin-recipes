odin-recipes is my first trial at not only in web development but also in Version history.

With my prior experience in HTML during middle school, I was able to quickly pick up the HTML concepts and hence this section was not something unfamiliar for me.

But the assignments and the learnings spread across evenly in The Odin Project curriculum helped me to effectively revisit and revise all the concepts.

As of version control it was my first trial and I got to learn a lot from this mini project about commits, effective commit messages, local and remote repos etc.

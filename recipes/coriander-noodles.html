    <p>
        This lip-smacking, hip-cracking, eyes-tracking, mind-slacking, health-packing recipe of Noodles is not any ordinary recipe available at your nearest streetside vendor. This Coriander 
        seasoned Noodle packs much more than what meets the eye.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Loaded with an extra punch of coriander with coriander powder, coriander paste and coriander leaves on top; the stingy and greenish taste will leave you with a disgusting taste in 
        the mouth but still craving for more. You just can't have enough of the pungency.
